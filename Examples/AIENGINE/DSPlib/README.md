# Using AI Engine functions from DSPlib

DSPlib is a library of commonly used DSP functions optimized for AI Engines. To facilitate the use of these functions in a design, Vitis Model Composer provides different DSPlib functions as blocks within the Xilinx Toolbox/AI Engine library. You can conveniently drag and drop one of these blocks into your model from the Simulink Library browser and configure the block.

Here we demonstrate how you can use these functions in Vitis Model Composer.

Here you see examples for FIR,FFT and Matrix Multiply functions.

## Knowledge nuggets

:bulb: For FIR and FFT examples, we are using the blocks available in AIEngine/DSPlib library directly. However, for matrix multiply example, we are importing the function as a graph from the  DSPlib shipped with Vitis Model Composer.

:bulb: You can find the DSPlib functions shipped with Vitis Model Composer at _$DSPLIB_ROOT/L2/include/aie/_ where the environmental variable _$DSPLIB_ROOT_ can be set in MATLAB command window using the command _setenv("DSPLIB_ROOT",xmcLibraryPath('get','dsplib'))_.
