# Rapid design exploration using Vitis Model Composer<a name="introduction"></a>

Within the Simulink environment, Vitis Model Composer offers a range of performance-optimized blocks that facilitate the design and implementation of DSP algorithms on AMD devices. The inclusion of the Vitis Model Composer AI Engine, HLS, and HDL libraries enables efficient algorithm exploration and greatly expedites the path towards production.

To learn more, visit the Vitis Model Composer [website](https://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/vitis/vitis-model-composer.html).

# Where should you start?
Are you interested in accelerating your development effort using Vitis Model Composer? Here is where to start:
* **Review the [supported operating systems and MATLAB releases](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis_Model_Composer/wiki/System-Requirements-for-Vitis-Model-Composer).**
* Learn the [basics](/Tutorials/Simulink_Basics/README.md) of Simulink. To use Vitis Model Composer effectively, you need to understand the basics of Simulink, 
a block diagram environment for multidomain simulation and model-based design.
* Go over to the [tutorials](/Tutorials/README.md). The tutorials will give you a solid understanding of how to use the tool.
* Browse through many of the examples we have here. You can easily access these examples from within the tool. (**Note:** Many of the examples require the [DSP System Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/dsp-system.html).)


# What's new in 2024.2?
* The [Filtering in Frequency Domain](./Examples/AIENGINE/Filtering_in_frequency_domain) example shows how to increase AI Engine throughput using different techniques.
* See a Vitis Model Composer testbench for a [fractional delay Farrow filter](./Examples/AIENGINE/Farrow_Filter).
* Working with both AI Engines and PL? See the [tutorials](./Tutorials/AIE-PL/README.md) showing how to connect the block libraries in Vitis Model Composer.
