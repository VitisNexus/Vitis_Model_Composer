# Vitis Model Composer for AI Engine Tutorial Series

Vitis Model Composer enables the rapid simulation, exploration, and code generation of algorithms targeted for AI Engines from within the Simulink® environment. You can achieve this by importing AI Engine kernels and data-flow graphs into Vitis Model Composer as blocks and controlling the behavior of the kernels and graphs by configuring the block GUI parameters. Simulation results can be visualized by seamlessly connecting Simulink source and sink blocks with Vitis Model Composer AI Engine blocks.

Vitis Model Composer provides a set of AI Engine library blocks for use within the Simulink environment. These include:
 * Blocks to import kernels and graphs which can be targeted to the AI Engine portion of Versal® devices.
 * Block to import HLS kernels which can be targeted to the PL portion of Versal devices.
 * Blocks that support connection between the AI Engine and the Xilinx HDL blockset.
 * Configurable AI Engine functions such as FIR, FFT, IFFT etc.

Vitis Model Composer can be used to create complex systems targeting the PL (RTL and HLS blocksets) and the AI Engine array (AIE blockset) at the same time. The complete system can be simulated in Simulink, and the code generated (RTL for the PL and C++ graph for the AI Engine array).

:warning: The AI Engine Lab can be done only in a Linux environment.
